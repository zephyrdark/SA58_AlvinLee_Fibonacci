### Building and running your application

When you're ready, start your application by running:
`docker compose up --build`.

Your frontend application will be available at http://localhost:3000. You should be able to use its functions.

If you want to test the backend application directly using Postman or similar API tools, it will be available at http://localhost:8080.
